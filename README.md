#### Generate your time table within a few clicks !

Timetabler is a web application that generates a timetable for every possible combination of lectures and their sections you are planning to enroll. Just pick the courses from the list, click add. And when you are done, click the Generate button and you will see the possible programs down below.

The data is coming form the latest announcements from the school. If you want to inspect the data, you can do so from <a href='http://oguzgelal.com/timetabler/data/ozu.json'>here</a>. If you have requests/comments or if you found a bug, please contact me. My mail address is <a href='mailto:oguz.gelal@ozu.edu.tr'>oguz.gelal@ozu.edu.tr</a>. Finally, please **DO NOT 100% rely on this!** Make sure you double check generated timetable is correct!

**To save a result set**, just hit CTRL + S on Windows, CMD + S on Mac OS X. You can name the file anything you want. The browser will download an additional folder next to the file, so you might want to download the file inside a seperate folder.
